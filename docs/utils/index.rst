Utilities (`utils`)

Introduction
============

`ctapipe.utils` contains a variety of low-level functionality used by
other modules that are not part of the `ctapipe.core` package.
Classes in this package may eventually move to `ctapipe.core` if they
have a stable enough API and are more widely used.
