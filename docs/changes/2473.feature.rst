Add a ``ctapipe-optimize-event-selection`` tool to produce cut-selection files,
based on a gamma, and optionally a proton and an electron DL2 file.
Two components for calculating G/H and optionally theta cuts are added:
``PercentileCuts`` keeps a certain percentage of gamma events in each bin and
``PointSourceSensitivityOptimizer`` optimizes G/H cuts for maximum point source sensitivity and
optionally calculates percentile theta cuts.

Add a ``ctapipe-compute-irf`` tool to produce irfs given a cut-selection file, a gamma,
and optionally a proton, and an electron DL2 input file.
Given only a gamma file, the energy dispersion, effective area, and point spread function are calculated.
Optionally, the bias and resolution of the energy reconstruction and the angular resolution can be calculated
and saved in a separate output file.
If a proton or a proton and an electron file is also given, a background model can be calculated,
as well as the point source sensitivity.

Irfs can be calculated with and without applying a direction cut.
Only radially symmetric parameterizations of the irf components are implemented so far.
