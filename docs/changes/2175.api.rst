Change default behaviour of ``run_rool``:

1. The default value of ``raises`` is now ``True``. That means, when using
   ``run_tool``, the Exceptions raised by a Tool will be re-raised. The raised
   exceptions can be tested for their type and content.
   If the Tool must fail and only the non-zero error case is important to test,
   set ``raises=False`` (as it was before).

2. If the ``cwd`` parameter is ``None`` (as per default), now a temporary directory
   is used instead of the directory, where ``run_tool`` is called (typically via
   pytest). This way, log-files and other output files don't clutter your
   working space.
