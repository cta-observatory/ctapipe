``QualityQuery`` is now a ``TelescopeComponent``.

You can now give different quality queries per telescope type or ID.
Change is backwards compatible, older configurations still work and
set the query-expression to the global value of the ``TelescopeComponent``.

It is still possible to use this as a ``Component``, when given no
``subarray`` during initialization (which is the default).
Here it does not make sense to give a ``key`` when calling or getting the table
mask, and it will fail if done so.
