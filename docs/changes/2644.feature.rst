Since not all ``EventSource`` plugins support providing the CTAO reference metadata,
the ``EventSource`` now has a property ``supports_reference_metadata`` which can
be overridden by subclasses to signal the support for reading reference metadata.

This avoids a warning for not being able to read reference metadata for
sources that cannot support it (yet), like the ``SimTelEventSource``.
