Update definition of the ``ctapipe.containers.EventType`` enum
to match an updated definition in the CTAO R1 and DL0 data models.

``SKY_PEDESTAL=2`` is changed to the generic ``PEDESTAL``,
which is expected from most cameras in real data.

New types added are ``SKY_PEDESTAL=5`` and ``RANDOM_MONO=18``.

These types were previously assigned at the subarray event level
but in fact are per telescope event in the data model.
A new field ``event_type`` was added to the ``TelescopeTriggerContainer``
and will be filled by the ``EventSource``-implementations in ctapipe.
