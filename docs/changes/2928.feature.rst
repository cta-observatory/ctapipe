Introduces the `~ctapipe.io.EventPreprocessor` class that can generically
transform an event table by applying the following steps:

* Generate new or rename existing columns with a `~ctapipe.core.FeatureGenerator`
* Select "good" event rows with a `~ctapipe.core.QualityQuery`
* Select which columns to output (by setting the ``features`` configuration
  attribute of the `~ctapipe.io.EventPreprocessor`)

This is useful for doing the final steps of DL2 processing, and will eventually
replace what is in `DL2EventPreprocessor` and `DL2EventLoader`, which will be
deprecated in a future release.

The `~ctapipe.core.EventPreprocessor` also includes the ability to pre-configure
itself for specific use cases by setting the ``feature_set`` option. Currently
only two `~ctapipe.io.ProcessingFeatureSet` are implemented:
`feature_set=dl2_irf`, which defines the transforms, event selection, and output
features for processing simulated DL2 events, and `feature_set=custom`, which
has no pre-configuration and requires all parameters to be set by the user in a
config file.

The functionality of `DL2EventLoader` can be mimicked with the following:

.. code-block:: python

    from ctapipe.io import TableLoader, EventPreprocessor
    from astropy.table import vstack

    DL2FILE = "some_dl2_file.h5"
    loader = TableLoader(DL2FILE, dl2=True, simulated=True, observation_info=True)
    preprocess = EventPreprocessor(feature_set="dl2_simulation")
    events = vstack(
        [
            preprocess(QTable(c.data))
            for c in loader.read_subarray_events_chunked(chunk_size=100_000)
        ]
    )
