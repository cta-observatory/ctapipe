As a consequence of fixing the bug #2921, `ctapipe.core.ExpressionEngine`
converts all input tables to `astropy.table.QTable` internally, which has a
small side effect on what is allowed in expressions: all columns with units are
now of type `astropy.units.Quantity`, instead of `astropy.table.Column`. Before,
an expression like ``"some_column.quantity.to(u.m)"`` would work if a ``Table``
was passed (but would fail for a ``QTable``). Now, that expression should be
``some_column.to(u.m)``
