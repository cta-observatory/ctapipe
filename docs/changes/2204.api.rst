CEP-002 has been implemented. This is a major API breaking change,
as the whole event container structure of ctapipe has been updated.

The main change is the inversion of the hierarchy of telescopes
and data levels.

Before, the data level came first and then below that
were mappings for each telescope:

.. code:: python

   event.dl1.tel[tel_id].parameters.hillas

Whereas now, the subarray event has a collection of telescope events,
which then contain the different data levels:

.. code:: python

   event.tel[tel_id].dl1.parameters.hillas

Fore more details, see :ref:`cep-002`.

With this, also the container structure itself has been largely refactored.
