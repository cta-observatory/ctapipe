Enhanced ``StatisticsAggregator`` classes to support time-based chunking in addition to event-based chunking.

Refactored with component-based chunking system using ``BaseChunking``, ``SizeChunking``, and ``TimeChunking`` components.
Statistics can now be aggregated over time intervals (seconds) rather than fixed event counts, enabling time-series analysis.
Time-based chunking supports ``chunk_duration`` and configurable overlap via ``chunk_shift``.

Breaking change: ``StatisticsAggregator`` now requires a ``chunking`` component to define chunking behavior.
