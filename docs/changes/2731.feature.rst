Added a new ``StereoDispCombiner`` implementing DISP-based stereo direction
reconstruction.
The algorithm is adapted and generalized from the implementations in
*magic-cta-pipe* and *EventDisplay* and resolves the head–tail ambiguity by
evaluating all DISP sign combinations and combining multiple telescope
combinations via weighted means.

The reconstruction supports optional pre-selection of telescopes using
``n_best_tels`` and rejection of nearly parallel multiplicity-2 events via
``min_ang_diff``.
Only geometry reconstruction is supported.
