Add a ``StereoDispCombiner`` implementing DISP-based stereo direction reconstruction.

Adapted from the implementation in magic-cta-pipe and EventDisplay, it combines
mono DISP reconstruction by:
- get combinations of 2 telescope for every array event
- calculating the minimum distance for the 4 possible SIGN pairs for each combination
- DISP sign score can be optionally used to weight the distances
- calculating the weighted average for the minimum distance SIGN pair (fov lon/lat) per combination
- calculating the weighted average of all combinations for an array event with the summed weights
