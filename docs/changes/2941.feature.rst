Add option to filter out telescope events using their trigger ``EventType``
in ``SoftwareTrigger``.
This is can be used e.g. to study mono telescope performance from Prod6
simulations by analyzing only telescope events with ``RANDOM_MONO`` event type
or muon tagging by only analyzing ``MUON`` events.
