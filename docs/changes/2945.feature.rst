Update PSFModel components to calculate the PSF with inputs in FoV coordinates in degrees.
In addition, the model parameters of the ComaPSFModel component are now distinct TelescopeParameter configurations.
The pixel width of each telescope type is not a configuration parameter of the ComaPSFModel component anymore, but instead it is obtained from the camera geometries of the subarray information.
