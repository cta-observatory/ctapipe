Fix misleading error messages if a non-existing file is passed
via the command-line to a Tool that has another configuration option
that uses ``Path(default_value=None, allow_none=False)``.

This pattern is now deprecated as it results in these hard to understand
error messages due to behavior deep in traitlets.

A warning will be raised if traitlets are defined like this and
all ctapipe tools have been adapted to explicitly check
for None if a ``Path`` is required.
