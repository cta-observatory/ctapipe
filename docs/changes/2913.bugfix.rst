Fixed bug that could in some cases lead to incorrect effective areas. In
simulated files with no simulation distribution present, the fallback was to use
the simulation configuration, but applying the number of reused showers was
missing in that computation. The fallback computation is now corrected, and more
checks were added to ensure consistency when both the simulation configuration
and shower distribution are present.
