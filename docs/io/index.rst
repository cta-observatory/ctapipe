Introduction
============

`ctapipe.io` contains functions and classes related to reading, writing, and
in-memory storage of event data


Reading Event Data
===================

This module provides a set of *event sources* that are python
generators that loop through an input file or stream and fill in
`ctapipe.core.Container` classes, defined below. They are designed such that
ctapipe can be independent of the file format used for event data, and new
formats may be supported by simply adding a plug-in.

The underlying mechanism is a set of `EventSource` sub-classes that
read data in various formats, with a common interface and automatic command-line
configuration parameters. These are generally constructed in a generic way by
using `EventSourceFactory.produce` or by using the helper function
`event_source(file_or_url)`, both of which will construct the
appropriate `EventSource` subclass based on the input file's type.
The former is recommended when configuration information should be
passed to a `ctapipe.core.Tool`, while the latter helper function qis useful
for small scripts or interactive use.

The resulting `EventSource`  then works like a python collection and can be
looped over, providing data for each subsequent event. If looped over
multiple times, each will start at the beginning of the file (except in
the case of streams that cannot be restarted):

.. code-block:: python3

  with EventSourceFactory.produce(input_url="file.simtel.gz") as source:
      for event in source:
         do_something_with_event(event)


If you need random access to events rather than looping over all events in
order, you can use the `EventSeeker` class to allow random access by *event
index* or *event_id*. This may not be efficient for some `EventSources` if
the underlying file type does not support random access.


Creating a New EventSource
==========================

Creating a new `EventSource` can be very simple, depending on how easily a
file format can be read into Python.

Firstly, one must create a new module to host their new `EventSource`, just
like "ctapipe.io.hessioeventsource". Inside this module create the new
`EventSource` with a relevant name and inherit from
`ctapipe.io.eventsource.EventSource`.

There are two methods that must be defined in the new `EventSource`:

`EventSource.is_compatible`:
    This function performs a simple check to see if the `input_url` is
    compatible with the EventSource. It is called by
    `EventSourceFactory.produce` to find a compatible `EventSource` to read
    the file.

`EventSource._generator`:
    This function handles the looping through the file and filling the
    `ctapipe.core.Container` for the event.

In order to avoid introducing additional dependencies, it is a requirement
that any external modules used in the reading of the file format are imported
in the `EventSource.__init__`. For an example see how `pyhessio` is
imported within `HESSIOEventSource`.

If a file format supports random event access, then an efficient method to seek
to an event can be created in `EventSource._get_event_by_index` and
`EventSource._get_event_by_id`, which `EventSeeker` will then utilise.

When creating tests for the new `EventSource`, it is important to still avoid
introducing dependencies. Therefore it is recommended to add a skip for the
tests if the external dependencies are not installed. This can be achieved
by either:

>>> import pytest
>>> pytest.importorskip("external_module")

To skip all the tests in the file, or:

>>> import pytest
>>> def test_something():
>>>    pytest.importorskip("external_module")

To skip a single test function.

The method to install the external software should be included in the
docstring of the `EventSource`, and also be added to the .travis.yml
file, so that the Travis CI can perform ALL tests. Additionally, a small test
file that is in the corresponding file format should be committed to
ctapipe-extra.

And finally, in order for `EventSourceFactory` to know about your
`EventSource` class, it must be included in the global namespace before the
`EventSourceFactory` is instanced. Therefore one should include it as an
import in the "ctapipe.io.eventsourcefactory" module.

Container Classes
=================

Event data that is intended to be read or written from files is stored
in subclasses of `ctapipe.core.Container`, the structre of which is
defined in the `containers` module (See reference API below). Each
element in the container is a `ctapipe.core.Field`, containing the
default value, a description, and default unit if necessary. The
following rules should be followed when creating a `Container` for new
data:

* Containers both provide a way to exchange data (in-memory) between
  parts of a code, as well as define the schema for any file output
  files to be written.
* All items in a Container should be expected to be *updated at the
  same frequency*. Think of a Container as the column definitions of a
  table, therefore representing a single row in a table. For example,
  if the container has event-by-event info, it should not have an
  item in it that does not change between events (that should be in
  another container), otherwise it will be written out for each event
  and will waste space.
* a Container should be filled in all at once, not at different times
  during the data processing (to allow for parallelization and to
  avoid difficulty in reading code).
* Containers may contain a dictionary of metadata (in their `meta`
  dictionary), that will become headers in any output file (this data
  must not change per-event, etc)
* Algorithms should not update values in a container that have already
  been filled in by another algorithm. Instead, prefer a new data
  item, or a second copy of the Container with the updated values.
* Fields in a container should be one of the following:
  
 * scalar values (`int`, `float`, `bool`)
 * `numpy.NDarray` if the data are not scalar (use only simple dtypes that can be written to output files)
 * a `ctapipe.core.Container` class (in the case a hierarchy is needed)
 * a `ctapipe.core.Map` of `ctapipe.core.Container` or scalar values,
   if the hierarchy needs multiple copies of the same `Container`,
   organized by some variable-length index (e.g. by `tel_id` or
   algorithm name)
   
* Fields that should *not* be in a container class:
  
 * `dicts`
 * classes that are not a subclass of `ctapipe.core.Container`
 * any other type that cannot be translated automatically into the
   column of an output table.


Serialization of Containers:
============================

The `ctapipe.io.TableWriter` and `ctapipe.io.TableReader` base classes provide
an interface to implement subclasses that write/read Containers to/from
table-like data files.  Currently the only implementation is for writing
HDF5 tables via the `ctapipe.io.HDF5TableWriter`. The output that the
`ctapipe.io.HDF5TableWriter` produces can be read either one-row-at-a-time
using the `ctapipe.io.HDF5TableReader`, or more generically using the
`pytables` or `pandas` packages (note however any tables that have
array values in a column cannot be read into a `pandas.DataFrame`, since it
only supports scalar values).
