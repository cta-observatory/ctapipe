Abstract
========

Currently, ctapipe supports computing all image parameters in two variants:

* Using a ``CameraGeometry`` where pixel coordinates are expressed in ``CameraFrame``, i.e.
  in length units (most commonly meters) on the camera focal plane.
* Using a ``CameraGeometry`` where pixel coordinates are expressed in ``TelescopeFrame``, i.e.
  in angular units (most commonly degree) on sky.

We propose to drop support for the first, to simplify code in multiple places and reduce
possibility for confusing the two similar variants of the image parameters.

The overhead of supporting both ``TelescopeFrame`` and ``CameraFrame`` representations
of the image parameters is quite significant, as it e.g. requires dealing with both
possible definitions in all Hillas-style dl2 reconstructors.


Advantages of Computation in TelescopeFrame
===========================================

Computing the image parameters in ``TelescopeFrame`` – angular units on the sky –
has the following advantages:

* Parameters are easier to compare across different telescope types.
* Pointing corrections can directly be applied in the conversion from ``CameraFrame``
  to ``TelescopeFrame`` and are then automatically included in the image parameters,
  which is much more straight forward than trying to correct image parameters that
  are affected to different degrees after they have been computed.
* Conversion from ``CameraFrame`` to ``TelescopeFrame`` will include any necessary
  special handling of the curved cameras of dual mirror telescopes.
