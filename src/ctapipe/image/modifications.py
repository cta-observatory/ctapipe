    Create a new image with values smeared across the

    These are what defines the sparse neighbor matrix
    and are available as attributes from the neighbor matrix.
    The amount of charge that is distributed away from a given
    pixel is drawn from a poissonian distribution.
    The distribution of this charge among the neighboring
    pixels follows a multinomial.
    Pixels at the camera edge lose charge this way.
    No geometry is available in this function due to the numba optimization,
    so the indices, indptr and smear_probabilities have to match
    to get sensible results.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    image: ndarray
        1d array of the pixel charge values
    fraction: float
        fraction of charge that will be distributed among neighbors (modulo poissonian)

    indptr: ndarray[int]

    smear_probabilities: ndarray[float]

    """
    Component to add NSB noise to R1 waveforms.

    This component in principle to be applied on MC shower simulations, to make
    them closer to real data in terms of noise level.

    There are two possibilities:
        1. The "showers MC" file has dark-NSB settings and electronic noise (
        waveform baseline fluctuations), and the input NSB file is a
        dedicated sim_telarray file, which must be produced with the same
        telescope array configuration (and other simulation settings) as the
        showers MC to which the noise is to be added, but containing only NSB
        noise (electronic fluctuations of the baseline should be switched off)

        2. The showers MC file is produced with no noise (baseline
        fluctuations) of any kind (electronic or NSB), just the Cherenkov
        signal (with the appropriate single-p.e.-response fluctuations),
        whereas the nsb file is a real data DL0 file from which only the
        interleaved pedestals are used (all gain channels must be present
        for all pixels). In that case, nsb_level must be =1 (to
        match the MC to the data) and shuffle_full_cameras=True (we do not
        want e.g. to duplicate stars in the FoV).


    In case (1), the number of available noise events per telescope in the NSB
    file must be at least twice the number of waveforms ("nsb_level") from
    that file that we want to add up. If the NSB file is produced with a
    level of 25% of dark NSB, and we want to simulate 10x dark NSB,
    then nsb_level=40 (=10/0.25) and the file must contain at least 80
    events. This is to guarantee that the different noise waveforms are not
    too correlated
