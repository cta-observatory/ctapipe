Installation for Users
----------------------

*ctapipe* and its dependencies may be installed using the *Anaconda* or
*Miniconda* package system. We recommend creating a conda virtual environment
first, to isolate the installed version and dependencies from your master
environment (this is optional).


Optionally create the virtual env:

::

  conda create -n cta ipython ipython-notebook
  source activate cta

Then, install the packages via:

::

  conda install -c cta-observatory ctapipe  

Developers should follow the development install instructions found in the
documentation above.
