Installation for Users
----------------------

*ctapipe* and its dependencies may be installed using the *Anaconda* or
*Miniconda* package system. We recommend creating a conda virtual environment
first, to isolate the installed version and dependencies from your master
environment (this is optional).


The latest version of ``ctapipe`` can be installed via::

  mamba install -c conda-forge ctapipe

or via::

  pip install ctapipe

**Note**: to install a specific version of ctapipe take look at the documentation `here <https://ctapipe.readthedocs.org/en/latest/getting_started_users/>`__.

**Note**: ``mamba`` is a C++ reimplementation of conda and can be found `here <https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba>`__.

Note this is *pre-alpha* software and is not yet stable enough for end-users (expect large API changes until the first stable 1.0 release).

Developers should follow the development install instructions found in the
`documentation <https://ctapipe.readthedocs.org/en/latest/getting_started/>`__.
