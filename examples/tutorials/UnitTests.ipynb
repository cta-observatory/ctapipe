    "**Code testing** is a good practice as soon as you start developping anything. It is crucial for two main reasons:\n",
    "- ensure that what you coded behave as expected (through *unit tests* and *integration tests*);\n",
    "- ensure that you don't break what you previously did when you are in the development process (*regression tests*).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will focus solely on *unit testing*, meaning that we will test only the smallest testable unit of the program. In most cases, it means that we will test  Python functions and classes. *Unit testing* is sometimes referred as ***whitebox testing***, because you have to know the content of your source code to test it properly. It can be opposed to ***blackbox testing*** (as *integration tests*) where you will test the wole code with a test case, not knowing what is inside the code, but knowing what it should return on this peculiar case.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could always test things directly on your code with `assert`ions, but it is both unefficient and it would be a pain to actually run all the tests you would have written. To make the task easier, different modules and frameworks exist for testing; I will here only talk about `unittest`, which comes from the standard library, and `pytest`, that is slightly more user-friendly (and included in your Anaconda distribution)."
