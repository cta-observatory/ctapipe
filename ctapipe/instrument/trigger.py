class SoftwareTrigger(TelescopeComponent):
    """
    A stereo trigger that can remove telescope events from subarray events.

    This class is needed to correctly handle super-arrays as simulated for
    CTA and still handle the LST hardware stereo trigger and the normal stereo
    trigger correctly.

    When selecting subarrays from simulations that contain many more telescopes,
    as is done in all major CTA productions to date, the stereo trigger is not
    correctly simulated as in that after selecting a realistic subarray, events
    are still in the data stream where only one telescope of the selected subarray
    triggered, which would in reality not trigger the stereo trigger.

    An additional complexity is the LST hardware stereo trigger, that forces that
    an array event has always to contain no or at least two LST telescope events.

    This means that after selectig a subarray, we need to:
    - Remove LST telescope events from the subarray if only one LST triggered
    - Ignore events with only 1 telescope after this has been applied

    With the default settings, this class is a no-op. To get the correct behavior
    for CTA simulations, use the following configuration:
