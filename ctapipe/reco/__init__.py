Reconstruction Algorithms

As an example, Hillas parameterization algorithms are implemented in
the hillas module. Things to resolve:

* the results for each are not consistent (factor of 2 in length/width?)
* the two use different output names. Should unify the output (e.g.
  define the columns somehow: in a class? a namedtiple?)
* or keep it simple, but in the Container wrapper map the dict to columns?
