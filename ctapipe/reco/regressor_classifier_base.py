    """This class collects one model for every camera type -- given by

    air-shower.  The class interfaces with `scikit-learn` in that it
    relays all function calls not exeplicitly defined here through
    `.__getattr__` to any model in its collection.  This gives us the
    full power and convenience of scikit-learn and we only have to
    bother about the high-level interface.

    The fitting approach is to train on single images; then separately
    predict an image's energy and combine the different predictions
    for all the telscopes in each event in one single energy estimate.

    TODO: come up with a better merging approach to combine the
          estimators of the various camera types

        list of identifiers to differentiate the various sources of

    unit: 1 or astropy unit
        scikit-learn regressors don't work with astropy unit. so, tell
        in advance in which unit we want to deal here in case we need
        one. (default: 1)
