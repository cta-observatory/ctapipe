class EventSeeker(Component):
    """
    Provides the functionality to seek through a
    `ctapipe.io.eventfilereader.EventSource` to find a particular event.

    By default, this will loop through events from the start of the file
    (unless the requested event is the same as the previous requested event,
    or occurs later in the file). However if the
    `ctapipe.io.eventfilereader.EventSource` has defined a `__getitem__`
    method itself, then it will use that method, thereby taking advantage of
    the random event access some file formats provide.

    To create an instance of an EventSeeker you must provide it a sub-class of
    `ctapipe.io.eventfilereader.EventSource` (such as
    `ctapipe.io.hessiofilereader.HessioFileReader`), which will be used to
    loop through the file and provide the event container, filled with the
    event information using the methods defined in the event_source for that
    file format.

    To obtain a particular event in a hessio file:

    >>> from ctapipe.io.hessioeventsource import SimTelEventSource
    >>> event_source = SimTelEventSource(input_url="/path/to/file")
    >>> seeker = EventSeeker(event_source=event_source)
    >>> event = seeker[2]
    >>> print(event.count)

    To obtain a particular event in a hessio file from its event_id:

    >>> from ctapipe.io.hessioeventsource import SimTelEventSource
    >>> event_source = SimTelEventSource(input_url="/path/to/file")
    >>> seeker = EventSeeker(event_source=event_source)
    >>> event = seeker["101"]
    >>> print(event.count)

    **NOTE**: Event_index refers to the number associated to the event
    assigned by ctapipe (`event.count`), based on the order the events are
    read from the file.
    Whereas the event_id refers to the ID attatched to the event from the
    external source of the file (software or camera or CTA array).

    To obtain a slice of events in a hessio file:

    >>> from ctapipe.io import SimTelEventSource
    >>> event_source = SimTelEventSource(input_url="/path/to/file")
    >>> seeker = EventSeeker(event_source=event_source)
    >>> event_list = seeker[3:6]
    >>> print([event.count for event in event_list])

    To obtain a list of events in a hessio file:

    >>> from ctapipe.io import SimTelEventSource
    >>> event_source = SimTelEventSource(input_url="/path/to/file")
    >>> seeker = EventSeeker(event_source)
    >>> event_indicis = [2, 6, 8]
    >>> event_list = seeker[event_indicis]
    >>> print([event.count for event in event_list])
