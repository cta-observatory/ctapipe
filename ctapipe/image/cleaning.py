    """Clean an image by selection pixels that pass a two-threshold
    tail-cuts procedure.  The picture and boundary thresholds are
    defined with respect to the pedestal dispersion. All pixels that
    have a signal higher than the picture threshold will be retained,
    along with all those above the boundary threshold that are
    neighbors of a picture pixel.

    To include extra neighbor rows of pixels beyond what are accepted, use the
    `ctapipe.image.dilate` function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    geom: `ctapipe.instrument.CameraGeometry`
        Camera geometry information
    image: array
        pixel values
    picture_thresh: float or array
        threshold above which all pixels are retained
    boundary_thresh: float or array
        threshold above which pixels are retained if they have a neighbor
        already above the picture_thresh
    keep_isolated_pixels: bool
        If True, pixels above the picture threshold will be included always,
        if not they are only included if a neighbor is in the picture or
        boundary
    min_number_picture_neighbors: int
        A picture pixel survives cleaning only if it has at least this number
        of picture neighbors. This has no effect in case keep_isolated_pixels is True

    Returns
    -------

    A boolean mask of *clean* pixels.  To get a zero-suppressed image and pixel
    list, use `image[mask], geom.pix_id[mask]`, or to keep the same
    image size and just set unclean pixels to 0 or similar, use
    `image[~mask] = 0`

def dilate(geom, mask):

    Add one row of neighbors to the True values of a pixel mask and return
