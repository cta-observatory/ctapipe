Image Cleaning Algorithms (identification of noisy pixels)


All algorithms return a boolean mask that is True for pixels surviving
the cleaning.

To get a zero-suppressed image and pixel
list, use ``image[mask], geom.pix_id[mask]``, or to keep the same
image size and just set unclean pixels to 0 or similar, use
``image[~mask] = 0``
