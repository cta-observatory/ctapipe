"""
Calibrator for the R1 -> DL0 data level transition.

This module handles the calibration from the R1 data level to DL0. This
transition exists as a conveniance in the pipepline and can be used to test
data volume reduction methods inside the pipeline. By default, no data volume
reduction is applied, and the DL0 samples are identical to the R1. However,
if a reducer from `ctapipe.image.reducers` is passed to the
`CameraDL0Reducer`, then the reduction will be applied.

    Parameters
    ----------
    config : traitlets.loader.Config
        Configuration specified by config file or cmdline arguments.
        Used to set traitlet values.
        Set to None if no configuration to pass.
    tool : ctapipe.core.Tool or None
        Tool executable that is calling this component.
        Passes the correct logger to the component.
        Set to None if no Tool to pass.
    reducer : ctapipe.calib.camera.reducer.Reducer
        The reducer to use to reduce the waveforms in the event.
